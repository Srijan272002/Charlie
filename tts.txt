The RTF value tells you how fast the generation is:
RTF < 1: Faster than real-time
RTF = 1: Real-time
RTF > 1: Slower than real-time

Let's break down each parameter's effect:

diffusion_steps (both functions)
- Range: 5-20
- Effect: Higher values give cleaner, more natural speech
- Trade-off: More steps = slower generation
- Recommended: 5 for quick tests, 10-15 for production

embedding_scale (both functions)
- Range: 0.5-2.0
- Effect: Controls speech expressiveness
- Lower values (0.5-0.8): More monotone, flat speech
- Normal values (0.8-1.2): Natural speech
- Higher values (1.2-2.0): More dramatic, emphasized speech

alpha (LFinference only)
- Range: 0-1
- Effect: Controls style consistency between sentences
- Lower values (0.3-0.5): More variation between sentences
- Higher values (0.7-0.9): More consistent style across sentences
- 0.7 is typically a good balance
